Adds a machine that keeps animals tame and trains them automatically.

This advanced Spacer machine can be built by completing the research for Ground Penetrating Scanner, Vitals Monitors, and Fabrication. The objective of the machine is to have a building that keeps your animals tame while your pawns do more important things. It should be noted that you can select a toggle that allows the machine to keep animals tame or to train animals up.

The Auto tame toggle keeps all of your tamed animals within its radius tame for as long as the machine has power. this can free up a lot of your pawns time if you have lots of animals and need to waste hours on animal upkeep.

The Auto train toggle selects a random animal to train up, it can pick an available slot the animal can be trained in. It should be noted the machine only trains one animal at a time.
